                    Jorge is currently a graduate student at the <a href="https://usc.edu"> University of Southern California </a>
                    with a focus in Machine Learning, and a research assistant at the <a href="http://clvrai.com">CLVR Lab </a>
                     under Professor Joseph Lim. <br /><br />
                    He worked as the Head of Technology at <a href="https://byprice.com">ByPrice</a>, mainly concentrated on
                    scaling system architecture for
                    internationalization to yield a data-driven strategy across multiple cloud platforms (GCP and AWS). Before that, he worked as a mixed Data Scientist
                    creating data-intensive solutions for users and costumers. Such solutions involved data munging processes, information integration from different web sources and combined
                    NLP-Computer vision classification tasks. As a web developer, he contributed to implementing REST APIs for
                    critical services such as session tokenization, price and product catalogues, 
                    etc.<br /><br />
                    He graduated from the Faculty of Engineering at  <a href="http://www.ingenieria.unam.mx/">UNAM</a> in Mexico,
                    where he obtained
                    a B.Sc. in Mechatronics Engineering. There, his thesis <a href="http://www.ptolomeo.unam.mx:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/132.248.52.100/10967/Tesis_JAVG_v3.pdf?sequence=1">
                        Genetic algorithm for bipedal gait patterns optimization</a> aimed to combine exploratory and search
                    algorithms to find
                    a solution of a high order dynamic system.<br /><br />
                    Before joining ByPrice he co-founded <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tuibo/tuibo-the-first-smart-garment-for-cyclists">
                        Tuibo</a> a tech company working to develop smart wearable devices for cyclists, and as an
                    undergraduate research assistant at
